# Current projects

Within [the 4-year research project](https://research.kuleuven.be/portal/nl/project/3H240572), funded by national organisation FWO (1S35225N), I will release the open-source materials used via this Github account. This includes (**current planning**)
- validated open-ended proof tests for 9th grade students
- closed-ended proof tests for 9th grade students
- the designed learning module to improve proof comprehension
- the statistical analyses and their pseudonimyzed datasets (alongside https://osf.io/)
